Okay so we need a mini HR portal for the company. Employees gotta log in obviously. They need a page to request time off, like picking the dates and writing a reason. Managers should have a dashboard to see all these requests and click approve or deny. Oh, and the system needs to shoot out an email to the employee when their request is approved. Wait, what happens if someone tries to request time off for a date that already passed? Make sure we handle that. Also, the HR admin needs to be able to add new employees to the system
